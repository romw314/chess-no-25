# Chess No. 25

Chess No. 25 is a simple and open source chess game for two players.

## Play

You can play some versions of Chess No. 25:

* Stable: [GitHub Pages](https://romw314.github.io/chess-no-25){:target=blank}, [Vercel](https://chess-no-25.vercel.app){:target=blank}
* Nightly: [Vercel](https://chess-no-25-nightly.vercel.app){:target=blank}

## GitHub Pages or Vercel

Chess No. 25 was originally deployed on GitHub Pages, but Vercel supports more configuration, preview deployments and up to 50 custom subdomains for every project so I recommend you to use Vercel. **The GitHub Pages version may stop working any time!**

The GitHub pages site may not work. If you have links to the GitHub Pages version of Chess No. 25 on your website or social media, please update them to the Vercel version.

So, use the Vercel version and if you are already using the GitHub Pages version, **migrate to Chess No. 25 on Vercel as soon as you can**.
