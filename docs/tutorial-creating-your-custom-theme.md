# Tutorial: Creating your custom theme for Chess No. 25

## Prerequisites

To create your own theme for Chess No. 25, you will need to have a GitHub account.
If you don't have a GitHub account already you can [create a new one](https://github.com/signup){:target=blank}.

In this guide we assume that you are using a Windows machine, but you can do the same steps on Linux or macOS (the steps may be a little different on other systems).

Want to create a theme _without coding_? Do it [here](https://github.com/romw314/chess-no-25/issues/new/choose){:target=blank} (takes less time to you, but will take longer to be accepted into Chess No. 25).

Already know what's JSON? Great! You may skip some parts of this tutorial and even [make this tutorial better for beginners](https://github.com/romw314/chess-no-25/edit/master/docs/tutorial-creating-your-custom-theme.md){:target=blank}.

Know the basics about Git and Node.js? Great! You can do these changes locally in your favorite editor and run unit tests with `yarn test` before committing, optionally try the theme with `yarn start`.

## 1. Fork Chess No. 25

> ***NOTE:***
>
> If you have already forked Chess No. 25, you can skip this step.

To start, [sign in to GitHub](https://github.com){:target=blank} and navigate to [the Chess No. 25 repository](https://github.com/romw314/chess-no-25){:target=blank}.

You should see something like this:

Click the **Fork** button. This will create your own fork (copy) of Chess No. 25 where you can make changes and then they can be accepted into the main Chess No. 25.

You should see something like this:
![Screenshot](img/finish-fork.jpeg)

Click the **Create fork** button. After a short time, it should take you into the newly created fork.

## 2. Choose what theme do you want to create

Choose what theme do you want to create and choose a proper and internal name.

The internal name should be one of these:

* The full name of the theme, but in camel case: special characters like `&` are removed, each word except the first starts with a capital letter and the first word is lowercase.
* An abbreviation of the full name of the theme.

For example, if you are creating a theme named `Lava`, the internal name should be `lava`.

Another example: if you are creating a theme named `Lavender & Vanilla`, the internal name should be `lavenderVanilla`, `lavenderAndVanilla` or `lv`.

## 3. Ensure that the theme do you want to create does not exist

Go to your newly created fork of Chess No. 25 on GitHub and enter `src/themes.json` into the **Go to file** text box. It should find a file named `src/themes.json` in the repository. Open the file by clicking it.

![Screenshot](img/search-themes-json.jpeg)

When the file opens, you should see something like this:

```json
{
	"themes": {
		"default": {},
		"dark": {
			"fullName": "Dark (default)",
			"bodyStyle": {
				"backgroundColor": "black",
				"color": "white"
			},
			"style": {
				"opacity": "0.8"
			},
			"images": "%-default-@.png",
			"square": {
				"lightColor": [
					"#333333",
					"darkgreen",
					"orange"
				],
				"darkColor": [
					"#111111",
					"darkgreen",
					"darkred"
				]
			}
		}
	}
}
```

So, let's explain the code. The code is spliited into "sections". The root section does not have a name. A section looks like this:

```json
{
	"a": 1,
	"b": {
		"a": "hello",
		"b": {
			"a": true
		}
	}
}
```

Every section has it's "childs". A child can be a string (text) wrapped in double quotes, a number, a boolean (`true` or `false`) or a sub-section. The section above has two childs: `a`, and `b`. `a` is a number, `b` is a sub-section which has two childs:

* `a` - a string
* `b` - a sub-section (because it's a child of `b`, we'll call it `b.b`)

Please note that `2` and `"2"` are diferrent. `2` is a number while `"2"` is a string.

A child can also be an array (a list of strings, numbers, booleans or sections).

In our example, `b.b.a` is a boolean (`true`).

In our themes.json, the root section has only one child - the `themes` section.

Each theme is a child of the `themes` section. For example, the dark theme (with full name `Dark` and internal name `dark`) is in the `themes.dark` section (not `themes.Dark`) and it's full name is in `themes.dark.fullName`.

Check if the `themes` section in the GitHub repository has a child with name same as the internal name of your theme.

Also check for other names. For example, if you are creating a theme named `Lavender & Vanilla` with internal name `lavenderVanilla`. Also check for themes named something like `lavenderAndVanilla`, `lavenderPlusVanilla`, `lv` or `vanillaLavender`.

## 4. Write the code for your theme

Go to your forked Chess No. 25 repo and click the button that will contain something like **1 Branch** or **2 Branches**. If you don't see the text, click **Code** in the top left corner.

Click **New branch** and enter some unique name for this branch. For example, if you are creating a theme named `Nature`, you can name it `add-theme-nature`. Then click **Create new branch**.

![Screenshot](img/create-branch.jpeg)

Click the created branch (you can click it either in **Your branches** or in **Active branches**).

![Screenshot](img/choose-branch.jpeg)

Enter `src/themes.json` into the **Go to file** text box and open the `src/themes.json` file.

Click the edit icon.

> **Remember:**
>
> * A "section" is something wrapped in braces (`{}`) that can have "childs".
> * A "child" can be a sub-section, a number, a string (text), a boolean or an array.
> * An array is a list of strings, numbers, booleans or sections. An array looks like this: `["hello 1", "second string", "another string", "last string"]`
> * A string must always be quoted.
> * A name of a section is a quoted string on the left side of a colon (`:`).

Add your own sub-section to the `themes` section of the file. The name of the section should be the internal name of your theme (**important!**). For example, if your theme's internal name is `nature`, the section will be named `nature`.

Your sub-section should have these childs:

Child name  | Type        | Required | Description
----------- | ----------- | -------- | -----------
`fullName`  | String      | Yes      | The full name of the theme.
`bodyStyle` | Sub-section | No       | You can set the `backgroundColor` and the `color` childs to [one of these values](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp) to adjust the background color and text color.
`style`     | Sub-section | No       | You can set the `opacity` child to numbers from 0 to 1 make the game darker or lighter.
`images`    | String      | No       | If you want to use your own images for pieces, don't set this. Otherwise, set this to `%-default-@.png`.
`square`    | Sub-section | No       | Sets the square colors. See below.

The `square` child of your sub-section should have two childs: `lightColor` and `darkColor`

`square.lightColor` defines the colors of light (white) squares and `square.darkColor` defines the colors of dark (black) squares.

Both `square.lightColor` and `square.darkColor` should be an array of three strings. The first string is the normal color of the square. The second string is the color when there is a selected piece on this square. The third string is the color when the selected piece can move to this square.

When you're done, click `Commit changes`, enter a good message for your change (for example `Add nature theme`) instead of the default `Update themes.json`. Then, click `Commit changes`.

### Example of adding a theme

We start with this:
```json
{
	"themes": {
		"default": {},
		"dark": {
			"fullName": "Dark (default)",
			"bodyStyle": {
				"backgroundColor": "black",
				"color": "white"
			},
			"style": {
				"opacity": "0.8"
			},
			"images": "%-default-@.png",
			"square": {
				"lightColor": [
					"#333333",
					"darkgreen",
					"orange"
				],
				"darkColor": [
					"#111111",
					"darkgreen",
					"darkred"
				]
			}
		}
	}
}
```

And we end up with this:

```json
{
	"themes": {
		"default": {},
		"dark": {
			"fullName": "Dark (default)",
			"bodyStyle": {
				"backgroundColor": "black",
				"color": "white"
			},
			"style": {
				"opacity": "0.8"
			},
			"images": "%-default-@.png",
			"square": {
				"lightColor": [
					"#333333",
					"darkgreen",
					"orange"
				],
				"darkColor": [
					"#111111",
					"darkgreen",
					"darkred"
				]
			}
		}
		"nature": {
			"fullName": "Nature",
			"bodyStyle": {
				"backgroundColor": "lightgreen"
			},
			"images": "%-default-@.png",
			"square": {
				"lightColor": [
					"orange",
					"green",
					"red"
				],
				"darkColor": [
					"black",
					"green",
					"darkred"
				]
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## 5. Upload your images

> ***NOTE:***
>
> If you don't want to upload your own images (your theme section's `images` child is set to `%-default-@.png`), you can skip this step.

Make sure all of your files are in a single folder on your computer as PNGs in the size of 32x32 pixels and each image has the name created from these parts separated by hyphens (`-`):

1. The lowercase name of the piece without "the" ([full list of pieces](https://www.chesswinner.com/the-complete-list-of-chess-pieces-names-and-values/#:~:text=Chess%20Pieces%20Names%20and%20their%20Values%20in%20the,5%205.%20The%20queen%206%206.%20The%20king){:target=blank})
1. The internal name of your theme
1. The lowercase name of the player, i.e. `light` or `dark`, not `white` nor `black`

When we commited our changes to themes.json, we have the file still open. To return back, click **Code** in the top left corner.

![Screenshot](img/click-code.jpeg)

Enter `src/img` into the **Go to file** text box and open the `src/img` folder.

![Screenshot](img/goto-folder-img.jpeg)

Click **Add file**, then **Upload files**.

![Screenshot](img/upload-files.jpeg)

Click the **choose your files** link and navigate to the directory with all of your images. Select all of the images and click **Open**.

![Screenshot](img/choose-your-files.jpeg)

Wait until the images are uploaded and write a good message for our change instead of the default `Add files via upload` (for example, `Upload images for the nature theme`).

Click **Commit changes**.

![Screenshot](img/commit-upload.jpeg)

Wait until the files are processed.

## 6. Create a pull request for our theme

Click **Code** in the top left corner.

![Screenshot](img/click-code.jpeg)

Click **Contribute**, then **Open pull request**.

![Screenshot](img/open-pr.jpeg)

Click **Create pull request**.

![Screenshot](img/create-pr.jpeg)

After a while, you will see that auto-checks are running and there is a **Visit Preview** link which you can use to try your theme. Please note that the right preview is the preview for **chess-no-25**, not **chess-no-25-docs**. You will also see the status which will be **Open**. When the status changes to **Closed**, it means that your new theme is declined. When the status changes to **Merged**, it means that your theme is accepted and you can find it on the [Chess No. 25 nightly version](https://chess-no-25-nightly.vercel.app){:target=blank}.

Even if the theme is declined, you can always use it on the preview link and submit another amazing themes.
